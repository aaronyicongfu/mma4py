# Overview
```mma4py``` is a parallel gradient-based optimizer that implements the method of moving asymptotes (MMA).
The algorithm is implemented in C++, and can be accessed from Python.
This project is based on [TopOpt_in_PETSc](https://github.com/topopt/TopOpt_in_PETSc), from which the source code of the implementation of MMA algorithm is obtained.

The original code can be found here: [https://github.com/topopt/TopOpt_in_PETSc](https://github.com/topopt/TopOpt_in_PETSc).

# How to use
To use ```mma4py```, simply define a custom class that implements the evaluation of objective, constraints and gradients, and feed the object to the optimizer.
An illustrative code snippet is shown below:

```python
from mma4py import Problem, Optimizer

class MyProb(Problem):
    def __init__(self, comm, nvars, nvars_l):
        ...

    def getVarsAndBounds(self, x, lb, ub):
        ...

    def evalObjCon(self, x, cons):
        ...

    def evalObjConGrad(self, x, g, gcon):
        ...

# Create problem instance
prob = MyProb(comm, nvars, nvars_l)

# Create optimization instance
opt = Optimizer(prob)

# Validate input gradients using finite difference
opt.checkGradients()

# Run optimization
opt.optimize(niter=100, verbose=True)

# Get the (distributed) optimized solution
xopt = opt.getOptimizedDesign()
```

See [examples/quadratic/quad-min.py](examples/quadratic/quad-min.py) for more details.


# Dependencies
- Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation ([PETSc](https://petsc.org/release/))
- MPI, mpi4py, pybind11


# Install

- First, you'll need to have a working installation of PETSc.
Please refer to [PETSc documentation](https://petsc.org/release/install/install_tutorial/) for instruction.

- Next, to compile ```mma4py```, first specify the PETSc installation path by ```export MMA4PY_PETSC_PREFIX=/path/to/petsc/install```, then do ```make``` at the root directory of ```mma4py```.

- To use ```mma4py``` in python from anywhere, add
```export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:~/git/mma4py```
to your shell dot file (i.g., ```.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.```).
